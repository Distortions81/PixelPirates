"Pixel Pirates"
Concept: A retro-style multiplayer game where players control pixelated pirate ships and sail across a procedurally generated ocean to find treasure and battle other pirates. The unique twist: players can design their own ships by adding blocks (like building a raft), but each block has different properties, and too much weight can sink your ship. The game becomes a balance of shipbuilding, resource gathering, and naval combat.
Why it's novel: The ship-building mechanic adds a creative element to competitive combat, while the pixel aesthetic keeps it approachable and charming.
Scope: Simple 2D pixel art, combined with procedurally generated maps and ship-building mechanics, makes this manageable for a solo developer.
